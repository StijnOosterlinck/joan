# Using the CarlaUE4 editor

We created a template map for you, and CARLA comes with a couple of maps too (check them out!). but, you probably want to create your own 

- You can create your virtual environment in CarlaUE4. The CARLA documentation has nice [tutorials](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tutorials-developers){target="_blank"}.
- The Unreal Editor itself also has some tutorials:
  - You can find the tutorials through `Help` &rarr; `Tutorials`
    - 'Landscape' explains how to adjust the map in height, color, and everything you need to know about the map
    - 'Foliage' has info on placing the visual objects, like trees, etc.
  - We recommend taking the 'Walkthrough'
- To create a road, you can use RoadRunner (see some instructions [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_A_add_map/#create-a-map-with-roadrunner){target="_blank"})
- [This website](https://www.raywenderlich.com/771-unreal-engine-4-tutorial-for-beginners-getting-started){target="_blank"} also provides an excellent resources for working with the Unreal Editor.
