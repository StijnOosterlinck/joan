The SensoDrive is a powerful/professional actuated steering wheel for simulation purposes, it communicates over CAN bus and 
can be used with JOAN. This section of the documentation mainly explains how to set and get parameters from the wheel
and what has been done in JOAN to make it work.

    Please be careful if you are going to work with the SensoDrive, it can deliver upto 20Nm of torque, which is quite a lot
    if you are testing with it ALWAYS KEEP YOUR THUMBS OUT OF THE WHEEL!
