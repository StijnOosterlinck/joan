# JOAN simulator documentation

Welcome to the JOAN Simulator documentation. In this 'readthedocs' the ins and outs of the JOAN Simulator will be elaborated upon.  We would also strongly recommend you to check out the CARLA documentation on which this simulator is heavily based:
[CARLA Documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

You can find the public repository [here][repolink]. Note that JOAN is still under development, so core functionality may change over time. We'll post releases as soon as we think we are ready :-)
