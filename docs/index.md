# JOAN simulator documentation

Welcome to the JOAN Simulator documentation. In this 'readthedocs' the ins and outs of the JOAN Simulator will be elaborated upon. We would also strongly recommend you to check out the CARLA documentation on which this simulator is heavily based:

## Structure
On the left you see the overall layout of the documentation. Starting with setting up but also including thorough documentation on the different modules and if you wish to add modules how to do so.

!!! Note
    If you cannot read the text in the GIFS or images please zoom in in your webbrowser, the resolution should then be high enough to distinguish the text.

## Team

JOAN is developed by members of the Human-Robot Interaction group at Cognitive Robotics of Delft University of Technology.
