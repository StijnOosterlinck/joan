# Setting up the simulator for Windows Documentation

## Introduction
In order to properly setup the simulation software on Windows several packages and steps are required, which will be elaborated upon in this section.

## Hardware Requirements
* __x64 system.__ The simulator should run in any 64 bits Windows system.  
* __50GB disk space.__ Installing all the software needed and CARLA will require quite a lot of space. Make sure to have about 50gb of space (especially since you will also need a visual studio 2017 install)
* __An adequate GPU.__ CARLA aims for realistic simulations, so the server needs at least a 4GB GPU. If VR is required a turing based GPU (for example the RTX branch of NVIDIA is highly recommended!)
* __Two TCP ports and good internet connection.__ 2000 and 2001 by default. Be sure neither the firewall nor any other application are blocking these.
