# Running JOAN and CARLA

These are the steps required from executing JOAN to driving your vehicle in CARLA. Note that with the development of JOAN, we might automate some of these steps for you.

### 1. Run JOAN and CARLA

Out-of-the-box, JOAN has a couple of modules included (for example CarlaInterface, HardwareManager, DataRecorder, Haptic Controller , DataPlotter and Experiment Manager). These should show up in JOAN HQ, JOAN's headquarters.

- To run JOAN, either execute (in a terminal):
```
    python main.py
```
    
Make sure that your virtual environment is activated (each line should start with `(venv)`).

Or, if you use PyCharm, click the green play button or right-click on `main.py` and click on `Run main`.

- To start CARLA, open the CarlaUE4, and open your map in CarlaUE4. 

- Hit the big play button in CarlaUE4

### 2. Add an input device

### 3. Add a vehicle

### 5. Initialize

### 6. Setup the variables you'd like to record and where to save them 

### 7. Get Ready

### 8. Run and Drive!
