# JOAN Overview

## High Level JOAN Structure
In this section we try to explain the overall high level structure of the JOAN framework. Please note that if you are interested
in adding your own modules you need a more thorough understanding than just this section, if that is the case please
also consult the [Advanced Steps Section](advancedsteps-add-custom-module.md) for more information.

In the image above you'll notice that JOAN consists mainly of 2 groups, namely the 'core' and the 'modules'. For now
 we'll leave the core be, however we will go into the modules here. Modules can be anything you want, because 
as it says in the name already JOAN has a 'Modular structure'. It is important to know what exactly is contained in a
JOAN Module, it is shown graphically below:


## Module

### Dialog

### (Multi) Process

### Settings 

### Shared Variables

### State
