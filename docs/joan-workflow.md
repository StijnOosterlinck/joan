# JOAN Workflow
In this section an overview of the workflow of JOAN is presented. 

!!! Note
    This document will only contain a workflow of the essential bare-bone modules (Carlainterface, Hardwaremanager & Datarecorder) to drive a car and record some data. This flow might change depending on your own implemented modules.

The workflow will be explained in several steps, a flow-diagram is also available at the end of this page.
