# Module: Haptic Controller Manager
The Haptic Controller Manager is a module which was specifically created to make different sort of controllers for haptic interactions. The 
example that is included is the `Four Design Choice Architecture (FDCA)` controller for haptic feedback on the steering wheel. However
the main idea behind this module is that it is that students can make their own sort of controller for haptic feedback. In this section
we'll explain the usage of the module, which will be strikingly similar to other modules, so if you understand the basic module
architecture you should be easily able to expand on this one.

In the image below the Haptic Controller Manager module is shown how it should look like if you open it up in the STOPPED state. (without default settings)

## Using the Module

## Adding to the Module
As said in the introduction adding to this module is quite similar to the other modules so please for a bit of a grasp refer to 
[adding your own agent](modules-carlainterface.md#adding_own_agents).
